that is built in to the hillside, with parts of it receding back into the 
hill, and other parts extending out in front. The castle is off-white and

![A ruined tower in the centre of the shot, clearly missing the top portion. 
In front of the tower is orange-ish tussock through which rocks protrude, 
and the remains of the walls that once surrounded the tower. The sky is 
overcast, and the whole area looks dark, as though it has just or is about 
to rain.](/img/post-bg.jpg)
