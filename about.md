I'm a software engineer for an agile consulting firm in London, and have
been here for the last couple of years.

Mostly, I work in Java, building web applications, or the backends for
mobile systems. Plus a bit of JavaScript and CSS for the frontend, if
necessary.

Prior to London, I was in New Zealand, working for a much smaller company
that developed software for banks & other finance companies, focusing
particularly on the credit industry. Again, primarily Java-based, though
with a bunch of SQL, BASH, Groovy, JavaScript, and other such things on 
the side.
